Connecting to Wifi:
	You need to use connect to a wifi network that needs only the name and the password. For example, a home wifi or a cafe wifi. UChicago
	wifi doesn't work because it has 3rd-party authentication.

Set WIFI_SSID variable to the name of the wifi network. 
Set WIFI_PASSWORD variable to the password of the network.

In Wifi.config() function, set the first variable to the IP address of your device, second variable to the DNS address of your network.
Leave the 3rd variable as is.

You will need the MindMonitor app sold on Google Play Store in order to run this app. It costs $15. I have the app and I will happily
demo the project for you if you would like to.
